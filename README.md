# Tic Tac Toe Game in Java

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game developed in Java! This project was completed as part of my Java development internship at Pinnacle Labs.

## Overview

This project implements a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Java, where two players (human vs. AI) take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Features

- Interactive gameplay allowing human players to make moves via the console
- Simple AI opponent that makes random moves
- Win-checking algorithm for rows, columns, and diagonals
- Dynamic display of the game board in the console

## Getting Started

To run the Tic Tac Toe game, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository.
3. Compile the Java files using `javac TAT_Game.java`.
4. Run the compiled program using `java TAT_Game`.

## Usage

- Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter row and column values to make your move.
- The game will alternate between the human player (X) and the AI opponent (O) until there's a win, draw, or the board is filled.
